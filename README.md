## How to replicate an experiment

In the following instruction, `XXX` refers to a section of name XXX

Run `Import`
  
Choose a dataset from `Data` and run the corresponding section, for example, `Data (Airfoil)`

Tune parameters in `Preparation and global parameters`. If you are not sure what parameters to use, you can refer to the previous recorded settings, for example `Results (Airfoil )`->`In order, Alpha 1`

Run from `Preparation and global parameters` to `Test the models`, this includes data preprocessing (standardizing), defining models, training models, and testing
